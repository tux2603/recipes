- brown bacon; drain on paper towel; brown hamburger in bacon drippings
- add all other ingredients except sour cream; simmer for 30-60 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes; add water a little at a time if it starts to dry out during this time (we usually end up adding about 1/4 cup water over the hour cooking time)
- stir in sour cream right before serving

- _note_: serve with noodles
