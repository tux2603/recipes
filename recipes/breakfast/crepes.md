- combine ingredients, stirring gently until batter is smooth. Cover and let batter rest for about 30 minutes or in the fridge until needed.
- heat pan. melt a small pat of butter before adding just enough batter to coat the bottom of the pan. Cook about 1 minute until set - it'll start to look dry. Flip and briefly cook the other side.

- _note_: this makes about 6-8 crepes, depending on pan size. This recipe doubles, triples, and quadruples well if needed.
- _note_: the basic ratio for crepes is, by weight, 1 part liquid : 1 part egg : 1/2 part flour
- _note_: batter can be stored in the fridge for up to 3 days. 
- _note_: if making sweet crepes, add a pinch of salt, 1 tablespoon of sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. If making savory crepes, add 1/2 teaspoon of salt - the liquid can be changed from milk to chicken or beef broth if you want more flavor
