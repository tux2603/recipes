- reduce heat, cover, and simmer until meat is tender, about 1 hour (stir every 15-20 minutes, adding water as necessary to maintain about 1.5 cups liquid)
- add potatoes, carrots, and tomatoes (if using cast iron pan, wait to add the tomatoes until right before adding the crust on top); continue to simmer for another 20 minutes
- preheat oven to 450
- dissolve cornstarch in 1/3 cup water; bring meat and veggies to boil then add cornstarch mixture, stirring constantly
- pour mixture into pie pan and top with [savory pie crust](../main_dishes/savoryPieCrust.md), cutting slits in top.
- bake at 450 for 20-30 minutes or until golden brown
