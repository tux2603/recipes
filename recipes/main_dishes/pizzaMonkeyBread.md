| 2 recipes     | [Pizza Dough](../breads/pizzaCrust.md) | Or 2 lbs of any other pizza dough |
| 12 oz         | Pepperoni                              | sliced or diced                   |
| 3 tablespoons | olive oil                              | plus or minus a bit               |
| 3/4 cups      | Parmesan cheese                        | grated                            |
| 1/2 teaspoon  | dried oregano                          |                                   |

- microwave pepperoni in a bowl for 60-90 seconds to render off fat. Move pepperoni to a paper towel lined plate, reserving pepperoni oil in bowl
- stir olive oil into pepperoni oil and use a few teaspoons to oil a 12 cup Bundt pan
- take one pound of dough and roll it into a ~18x9" rectangle
- lay out half of the pepperoni evenly along the entire length of the dough rectangle, running parallel to and ~2" from the long edge
- lay down four Mozzarella sticks next to the pepperoni, and sprinkle half of the Parmesan and oregano on top of them
- tightly roll up the dough, then cut the resulting dough log in half, thirds, and then half again to get 12 chunks, sealing the ends after each cut
- repeat the previous four steps with the remaining pound of dough
- take each little ball of dough and brush lightly with the oil mixture to prevent sticking, then place in the Bundt pan
- cover and allow to rise for ~30 minutes while preheating oven to 400Â°F. Adjust oven racks to mid-lower position
- when oven is preheated and dough has had a chance to rise, place Bundt pan in oven and cook until browned, ~30 minutes
- let cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan
