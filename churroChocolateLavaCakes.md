| 2 teaspoons   | vanilla       |             |

- break up the chocolate into small chunks and combine with the heavy cream. Heat the chocolate cream mixture until the chocolate is melted, stirring occasionally
- once the chocolate has fully melted and the mixture is glossy, stir in 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Cover the ganache and let cool in the refrigerator until set, about one hour
- once ganache is cooling, preheat oven to 350Â° and grease a large muffin tin
- mix together all remaining dry ingredients in a large bowl, then add the egg, milk, melted butter, and remaining vanilla and whisk until combined into a thick (?) batter
- mix the cinnamon and sugar together on a large plate. Divide the batter into equal pieces and roll each of the pieces in the cinnamon sugar mixture until combined
- remove the cooled ganache from the refridgerator, and spoon a scoop into each of the muffin tin holes
- place the balls of dough into the muffin tin on top of the ganache
- cook for ~20 minutes, until golden and a toothpick comes out clean
