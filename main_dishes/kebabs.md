| 1 teaspoon    | mint                  |                     |

| 1.5 teaspoons | unflavored gelatin    |                     |
| 1 cup         | plain yogurt          |                     |
| 2 tablespoons | lemon juice           |                     |
| 2 tablespoons | tahini                |                     |
| 1 clove       | minced garlic         |                     |
| 1/2 teaspoon  | salt                  |                     |

- finely chop pine nuts
- in small bowl, mix together all spices listed above lamb to create paste (or spice mix if using powdered onion/garlic - which actually works better in this recipe)
- in large bowl, mix together lamb and gelatin; gradually add spice mixture to make sure it gets incorporated evenly
- form into 10 cylinders
- if grilling, insert skewers and refrigerate for at least 1 hour; grill over hot fire, 45 degree angle with grate; cook until browned and meat releases from grate, 4-7 minutes, flip and cook until browned on second side and meat reads 160, about 6 minutes longer
- if baking, place on cookie sheet to bake similar to mini meatloaves; preheat to 350; bake for 20-30 minutes

---

- _note_: can use hamburger or meatloaf mix in place of lamb; if using other ground meat, increase garlic to 5 cloves, paprika to 2 teaspoons, and cumin to 2 teaspoons
- _note_: can use vanilla yogurt instead of plain; whole milk yogurt tastes best, but lowfat works
- _note_: can use cilantro in place of coriander
- _note_: serves nicely on small or medium wraps; also goes well with spinach (or lettuce) as a topper
