| Amount   | Ingredient | Prep Notes |
| -------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| 1 pound  | spaghetti  |            |
| 1 pound  | bacon      |            |
| 1/4 cup  | olive oil  |            |
| 3        | eggs       |            |
| 1 cup    | Parmesan   |            |
| 2 cloves | garlic     | minced     |
| 1/2 cup  | white wine |            |
|          | salt       | to taste   |
|          | pepper     | to taste   |

- cut bacon up into small bits and brown in olive oil. Add wine and cook until shimmering. Allow enough time for most of the alcohol to cook off and then remove from heat. Set aside and reserve liquid
- boil water for spaghetti and cook until al dente
- while spaghetti is cooking, beat the eggs, cheese, and garlic together in a small bowl
- when the spaghetti is done cooking, set aside a small amount of the noodle water. Drain the spaghetti and immediately transfer it back into the pan and add the egg mixture, stiring constantly. Once combined, add the bacon and reserved liquid. Yes, it's a lot of oil. This isn't a healthy dish
- add salt and pepper until it tastes right. If it is particularly thick, add some of the reserved noodle water

---

- _note_: Chicken broth works as a substitute for the wine
- _note_: If you have especially fatty bacon, cut back on the olive oil
- _note_: The residual heat from the noodles is what cooks the eggs, so add the eggs in ASAP after draining the noodles
