| 2.25 cups           | long grain white rice | eg, Jasmine or basmati rice              |
| 4.5 tablespoons     | butter                |                                          |
| 3 ounces (1/2 cups) | orzo                  |                                          |
| 1.5 cups            | onion                 | grated or diced                          |
| 1.5 clove           | garlic                | minced                                   |
| 3.75 cups           | chicken broth         |                                          |
| 1 teaspoon          | salt                  |                                          |
| 1/4 cups            | fresh parsley         | minced, much less if using dried parsley |
| 1 pack              | kielbasa (optional)   |

- Place rice in a bowl and pour hot tap water over it. Let stand for 15 minutes
- Swish around the rice to release any extra starch and pour off water. Rinse with cold water 3 to 5 times
- If adding kielbasa, slice it and brown it in a saucepan, then remove from the saucepan and set it aside
- Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat, add pasta and cook until browned
- Add onion and garlic, cook until onion is softened but not browned
- Add rice and cook until edges start to become translucent, about three minutes
- Add chicken broth and salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until all the liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes
- remove from heat, place a dish towel over the top of the pan, and then replace the lid. Let stand for 10 minutes
- Fluff rice with a fork, add parsley, and kielbasa if using

- _note_: Can serve with cheese and tortilla shells
