| -------------- | :-------------- | :--------- |
| 4 teaspoons    | vegetable oil   |            |
| 2 pounds       | ground beef     | lean       |
|                | salt            |            |
|                | pepper          |            |
| 1              | onion           |            |
| 1/2 small head | cabbage         | chopped    |
| 1 cup          | chicken broth   |            |
| 8 ounces       | co-jack         |            |
| 1/2 cups       | whole milk      |            |
| 1/2 cups       | water           |            |
| 6 tablespoons  | unsalted butter |            |
| 1/4 cups       | sugar           |            |
| 3.5-3.75 cups  | flour           |            |
| 1 tablespoon   | yeast           |            |
| 1/2 teaspoon   | salt            |            |
| 1              | large egg       | beaten     |

- heat oil in a dutch oven until just smoking. Add beef, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper and cook until liquid evaporates and meat begins to sizzle (10-15 minutes). Drain meat in colander and set aside.
- add remaining 2 teaspoons of oil to the dutch oven and heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook until it just begins to brown.
- stir the drained meat, cabbage, and chicken broth into the onion and bring to a simmer. Cover the mixture and cook until the cabbage is tender (~5 minutes). Uncover and continue to cook until the liquid evaporates and the mixture starts to sizzle.
- season with salt and pepper to taste, then transfer the mixture to a bowl and let cool for 15-30 minutes. Stir in cheese and then refrigerate until ready to assemble beef buns.
- combine milk, water, butter, and sugar and heat to 110 degrees.
- mix 3.5 cups of flour, yeast and salt until combined.
- while continuing to mix the dough, slowly pour in the milk mixture and a beaten egg.
- mix and knead the dough together until it's done, adding more flour if necessary.
- cover the dough and let it rise in a warm place until doubled in size.
- adjust oven racks to an upper and middle position and preheat to 375 degrees. Prepare two baking sheets with parchment paper.
- divide the dough into 12-15 pieces (about 2.25 to 2.75 ounces), roll into balls, and let rest for 5 minutes
- stretch each of the dough balls out into a flat circle, and scoop half a cup of filling onto it. Wrap the dough around the filling and pinch it together to seal.
- transfer the stuffed and sealed dough balls to the prepared baking sheets, with the seam side down.
- cover the assembled beef buns and let them rise for another 45 to 60 minutes.
- bake the beef buns for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown, switching and rotating the trays halfway through.
- let sit for 15 minutes before eating
