- boil chicken until cooked, then remove from the water and shred it with forks.
- put oil in a dutch oven and heat it. Add onions and cook until just beginning to brown
- add broth, chicken, and 1.25 teaspoons salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer.
- meanwhile, measure flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoons of pepper, and baking powder into a gallon zip lock bag. Seal and shake the bag to mix
- re-open the bag and add the beaten eggs, **1/2 cups** of half & half, and 1/2 cups of water to the mixture. Reseal and knead the bag to combine, refrigerate until ready to use.
- add potatoes and carrots to the broth and simmer for 10 minutes, then take the bag of dough and cut one of the corners off. Squeeze the dough out through the hole, using scissors to snip apart dumplings sized chunks.
- simmer until dumplings float to the surface, about 10-15 minutes. Remove soup from heat and stir in remaining **1/2 cups** of half & half.
