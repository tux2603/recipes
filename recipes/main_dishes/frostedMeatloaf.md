| 1/2 teaspoon  | pepper              |                                            |
| 2 pounds      | potatoes            | peeled and cut into chunks                 |

- mix together ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar, and hot sauce in a small bowl to make a glaze, set aside
- melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a skillet over medium heat, then add the onion and cook until softened and browned. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, then remove from heat and set aside
- combine the crushed saltines and 1/3 cup of milk in a large mixing bowl and mash it with a fork to form an even paste. Add the pork, beef, eggs, egg yolk, parsley, mustard, Worcestershire, thyme, salt, pepper, and the onion mixture and mix until just combined. Add the ground beef and mix until combined
- place a wire cooling rack on a rimmed baking sheet and put a 14"x6" piece of aluminum foil on top of the cooling rack. Poke the aluminum foil with a fork to make a few holes to allow drippings to escape, then form the meat mixture into 9"x6" loaf and place it on the foil
- place meatloaf under the broiler and broil until top is browned, 5-7 minutes. Remove from oven and brush the glaze over the top of the meatloaf, then return to the oven and broil until the glaze is browned, 3-5 minutes
- set the oven to 350°F, move the meatloaf to the middle rack, and bake until the internal temperature reaches 160°F, 40-45 minutes
- while the meatloaf is cooking, prepare the potatoes for the frosting. Wash, peel, and slice the potatoes, then boil them in a large pot until they're mashable, 20-25 minutes. Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot. Add the remaining 6 tablespoons of butter, 1/2 cup of milk, and some more salt and then mash them until smooth. Add more milk if necessary to get the desired consistency
- when the meatloaf is done cooking, remove it from the oven and spread the mashed potatoes over the top and sides. Place the frosted meatloaf under the broiler and broil until the potatoes are browned, about 15 minutes. Let the meatloaf rest for an additional 15 minutes before serving to allow the internal temperatures to settle

- _note_: potatoes can be steamed instead of boiled
- _note_: the glaze is good, make more as desired
