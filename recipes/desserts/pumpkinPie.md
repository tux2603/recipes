| pinch        | ground cloves                             |            |
| 1/2 teaspoon | salt                                      |            |
| 2/3 cup      | heavy cream                               |            |
| 2/3 cup      | milk                                      |            |
| 4            | eggs                                      |            |

- follow the directions for a partially baked pie crust
- while the crust is baking, make filling
- in a medium bowl, whisk together heavy cream, milk, and eggs
- in a saucepan, combine pumpkin puree, brown sugar, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt. Bring to a sputtering simmer over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly until thick and shiny, 5-15 minutes.
- remove pan from heat and whisk in cream mixture.
- as soon as the crust comes out of the oven, adjust oven rack to lowest position, place rimmed baking sheet on rack, and increase oven temp to 400.
- pour warm filling into hot crust. You may not need all of the filling - only use as much as the crust will hold. If there's extra, you can add more after the pie has cooked for about 5 minutes and settled a bit.
- bake 10 minutes at 400, then decrease oven temperature to 300.
- bake about 20-35 minutes longer or until the filling is puffed, dry looking, lightly cracked around the edges, and center wiggles like jello when shaken. The temperature should read 175 when taken at the center of the pie.
- cool to room temperature, 1-2 hours
- serve or refrigerate until ready to serve.

---

- _note_: pumpkin pie leftovers need to be refrigerated. Holds nicely in fridge for 2 days.
- _note_: extra filling can be refrigerated for 1 day or frozen for 1 week.
- _note_: if you have extra plain pumpkin puree, it can freeze for up to 6 months.
