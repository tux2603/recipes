| 2.5 cups         | milk               |                            |
| 2 cups           | flour              |                            |
| 2.5 teaspoons    | yeast              |                            |
| 1 stick          | butter             | melted and cooled          |
| 1 teaspoon       | sugar              |                            |
| 1 teaspoon       | salt               |                            |
| 2                | eggs               | beaten                     |
| 1/4 teaspoon     | baking soda        |                            |
| 1 teaspoon       | vanilla            |                            |

- *the night before*...
- warm milk to 110 degrees (if you don't have a thermometer, 110 should feel slighly warm but not at all hot when you stick your clean finger in it)
- in large bowl, combine warm milk, flour, yeast, butter, sugar, and salt. Stir until no lumps remain.
- cover and let sit at room temperature for 8-12 hours. Batter will rise and bubble.
- preheat waffle iron
- add eggs, baking soda, and vanilla to batter, mixing well
- spray waffle iron with nonstick spray if needed
- ladle batter into iron until surface is covered, close and cook until waffle has risen and turned golden brown. Waffle is ready to remove when you can no longer see steam escaping from the iron

- _note_: this recipe doubles well. We usually make a recipe and a half and have 0-2 leftovers.
- _note_: extra batter can be stored covered in the fridge for up to 3 days. Cooled leftover waffles freeze well. Use the toaster to warm them back up straight from the freezer.
- _note_: for the butter, you want to melt it then let it cool just enough to not kill your yeast - it should still be liquidy, but won't be as clear as freshly melted butter - this will take 5-10 minutes
