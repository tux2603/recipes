| 1 cup            | milk               |                            |
| 2                | eggs               | beaten                     |
| 1/2 stick        | butter             | melted                     |
| 1 teaspoon       | vanilla            |                            |
| 1.5 cups         | flour              |                            |
| 2 tablespoons    | sugar              |                            |
| 2 teaspoons      | baking powder      |                            |
| 1 teaspoon       | salt               |                            |

- in small bowl, mix melted butter into milk. Add eggs and vanilla. Mix well.
- in large bowl, combine dry ingredients. Mix well. Add wet ingredients and stir gently until batter is smooth.
- cook on a lightly oiled surface. Pancakes are ready to flip when batter bubbles stay open rather than closing right away.

- _note_: this makes about 8 four inch pancakes. This recipe doubles, triples, and quadruples well if needed.
- _note_: you can replace half the milk with buttermilk or yogurt. You can replace up to 1/4 of the flour with wheat flour.
- _note_: this makes a thicker pancake. If you want thinner pancakes, add up to 2 tablespoons more milk. Thicker pancakes can more easily carry additions such as chocolate chips or blueberries - add these after you pour batter onto griddle unless everyone wants exactly the same additions.
- _note_: extra batter can be stored covered in the fridge for up to 3 days.
