| 1 pound       | pork tenderloin  |            |
| 2 tablespoons | olive oil        |            |
|               | salt             | to taste   |

| 1 teaspoon    | garlic powder    |            |
| 1 teaspoon    | thyme            |            |
| 1 teaspoon    | basil            |            |
| 1/4 teaspoon  | rosemary         |            |
| 1/4 cup       | soy sauce        |            |
| 1/2 cup       | balsamic vinegar |            |
| 1 1/4 cups    | water            | divided    |
| 2 tablespoons | cornstarch       |            |

- rub tenderloins with oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, thyme, basil, and rosemary. Saute the tenderloins, turning every few minutes, until browned on all sides
- add the soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, and 1 cup of water to the pressure cooker and stir to combine. Add the tenderloins and lock the lid in place. Cook on high pressure for 15 minutes
- allow the pressure to release naturally for 5 minutes, then release the remaining pressure manually
- remove the tenderloins from the pressure cooker and set aside
- whisk together the cornstarch and remaining 1/4 cup of water in a small bowl until smooth. Bring the sauce to a boil, then whisk in the cornstarch mixture and boil until thickened into a glaze

- _note_: works well on sandwiches or in wraps. Co-pilot says it would be good on a pizza, I'm not sure if that's a good idea or not
