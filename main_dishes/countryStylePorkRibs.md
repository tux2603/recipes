- preheat oven to 350
- pat ribs dry and season with salt and pepper, heat 1 tablespoon oil in dutch oven over medium high heat, brown ribs on all sides, working in batches if needed
- remove the ribs to a plate, reduce heat to medium and heat remaining tablespoon oil, cook onions until soft, about 5 minutes
- add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute, add carrots and tomato paste and cook 3-5 minutes
- deglaze the pan with the vinegar, then add red pepper flakes and bay leaves
- add the ribs back to the pan and add enough stock to reach halfway to three quarters of the way up the sides of the ribs
- bring to a simmer, cover, and place in oven
- cook until meat is fork tender, about 1.5 hours, stir after 1 hour, making sure there is still liquid one quarter to halfway up the sides of the ribs, add a little stock if needed
- when meat is tender, uncover and cook an additional 10-20 minutes until liquid is reduced to liking
- serve with [polenta](../sides/polenta.md)

- _note_: if you can't find boneless country style ribs, bone-in works; increase the amount to 3 pounds to account for the weight of the bones; there will be a little more grease; you can remove the bones before serving or just serve bone-in
-  _note_: you can soften about 12 ounces frozen mirepoix in place of the onions
-  _note_: you can substitute parsnips for some of the carrots
-  _note_: you can substitute boneless beef short ribs; if you do this, use beef stock instead of chicken stock; you can also choose to switch out the red pepper flakes in favor of thyme
