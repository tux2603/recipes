| 4 tablespoons       | butter         |
| 1 cup       | minced shallots (about 8 medium shallots)            |
| 2 tablespoons    | flour        |
| 3.5 cups      | chicken broth |
| 2 pounds   | frozen peas                                         |

- remove peas from freezer
- heat butter in large pan over low heat until foaming; add shallots; cover and cook until softened, about 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally
- remove lid and add flour, stirring until flour is completely incorporated; gradually whisk in chicken broth
- increase to high until boiling; reduce to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes
- add peas; increase heat to medium-high; cover and cook for 5 minutes or until soup has come to a simmer
- uncover; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes
- puree soup with an immersion blender (a blender or food processor will work if you work in small batches - return to pan)
- stir in heavy cream before serving; season to taste with salt and pepper

- _note_: serve with shredded parmesan or croutons if desired
