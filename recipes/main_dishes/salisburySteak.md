- combine milk, potato flakes, salt, and pepper to form a panade
- mix ground beef into panade until combined, then shape into patties of the desired size
- melt half of the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat then add the patties and cook until browned on both sides, ~5 minutes per side
- remove patties from skillet and set aside
- melt the remainder of the butter in the now empty skillet, then add the onion and cook until softened and browned
- add the mushrooms and cook until they're also softened and starting to brown
- stir in the flour and tomato paste and cook briefly then slowly add the beef broth and red wine, stirring constantly
- return the patties to the skillet, reduce heat, cover, and cook until the patties are cooked through, ~10 minutes
- remove patties from the skillet and simmer the sauce until it's thickened
