<small>Servings: about 60 buckeyes</small>

| Amount        | Ingredient           | Prep Notes |
| ------------- | :------------------- | :--------- |
| 3 cups        | powdered sugar       |            |
| 1 1/2 cup     | peanut butter        |            |
| 1 teaspoon    | vanilla              |            |
| 1/2 cup       | butter               | softened   |
| 10 oz         | dark chocolate chips |            |
| 2 tablespoons | peanut butter        |            |

- slowly fold the 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter, butter, and vanilla into the powdered sugar
- knead or squeeze until the mixture reaches a smooth consistency, adding more powdered sugar if needed
- form the peanut butter mixture into about sixty small balls ~1" in diameter. Place the balls on a tray and freeze for about one hour
- once the peanut butter balls are frozen, melt chocolate and 2 tbsps of peanut butter in a double boiler or microwave
- poke a toothpick into the peanut butter balls and use it as a handle to dip them into the melted chocolate, leaving a small circle of the peanut butter ball uncovered
- return the buckeyes to the tray and allow the chocolate to set

---

- _note_: a 16 oz jar of peanut butter is almost exactly the right amount for this recipe
- _note_: dark chocolate chips provide a nice contrast to the sweetness of the peanut butter core, but any type of chocolate will work as long as it melts smoothly
- _note_: crisco or food grade parrafin can also be melted in with the chocolate
