- cut pepperoni sticks into at least 48 wedges, each about four inches long. Place wedges in a large bowl and microwave at medium power until the oil is rendered out, about three minutes. Reserve 3 tablespoons of oil and roll pepperoni sticks in some flour
- combine water, milk, and sugar and microwave until 110°, 1-2 minutes. Stir in reserved pepperoni oil
- mix flour, yeast and salt until combined. Slowly add milk mixture into dry ingredients and mix until incorporated
- knead dough until shiny and smooth, adding more flour if necessary
- coat dough in a small amount of pepperoni oil to prevent sticking, cover and let rise for until doubled in size, 50-60 minutes
- divide dough into 16 even pieces, form into balls, and let rest for about five minutes
- line a baking sheet with parchment paper and preheat oven to 375°
- stretch dough into rectangle, place three or so pepperoni sticks on the rectangle, role them up, and then place on lined baking sheet seam down
- cover and let rise for 30-60 minutes, depending on how puffy you want them
- brush rolls with egg mixture if sprinkle with sesame seeds if you're using them. Bake until golden brown, about 24-28 minutes, rotating halfway
- let cool for 15 minutes before serving
