- preheat oven to 300
- dredge meat in flour; brown
- place meat in casserole pan or small roasting pan; add veggies
- combine broth, herbs, and Worcestershire sauce ; bring broth mixture to boil and pour over meat and veggies
- cover and cook for approximately 2-3 hours or until meat is fork tender

- _note_: the key to tender pot roast is a low temperature for a long cook time; figure anywhere from 275-325 for about an hour a pound to get a fork tender roast
