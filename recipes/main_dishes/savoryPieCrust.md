| --------------- | :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.5 cups        | flour         | 7.5 oz                                                  |
| 1/2 teaspoon    | salt          |                                                         |
| 4 tablespoons   | Crisco        | can substitute butter. It's actually better when you do |
| 8 tablespoons   | butter        |                                                         |
| 3-4 tablespoons | chilled water | approximate. Keep it cold                               |

- mix flour and salt in large bowl
- cut in Crisco and butter
- add chilled water until dough pulls together
- make into disk or square (depending on shape of pan)
- wrap in wax paper or plastic wrap; refrigerate at least 30 minutes

- _note_: can use all butter if preferred over butter and Crisco
- _note_: it's very important not to mix the dough any more than is necessary after the water is added
