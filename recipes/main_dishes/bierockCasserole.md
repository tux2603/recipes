- dough
- wake up the yeast - warm 1/4 cup milk to about 110 degrees (15-20 seconds in the microwave). Stir in the yeast and 1 tablespoon sugar. Let sit about about 5 minutes or until the mixture is bubbly.
- in large bowl, mix together flour, baking powder, salt, and remaining tablespoon sugar. Stir in remaining 3/4 cup milk, melted butter, and yeast mixture. Knead until smooth. Dough will be sticky, but you may need to add flour (up to 2 tablespoons) so it's kneadable.
- cover bowl and let rise about 30 minutes. The dough will be ready by the time your filling is prepped and cooled.
- filling
- preheat oven to 375
- heat oil on medium high heat until shimmering. Add onions and cook until transparent and just starting to color. Remove onions to samll bowl.
- brown hamburger, drain, and return to pan. Turn burner down to medium, add cabbage, onion, chicken powder, and 1 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Cover and cook for 5-10 minutes or until cabbage is wilted. If it's sticking to the bottom of the pan, add a splash of water (up to 1/4 cup) to pan while cabbage is wilting.
- stir in 1 tablespoon flour. Once it's all mixed in, add cheese and mustard. Salt and pepper to taste.
- transfer filling to 9x13 pan and cool for 10 minutes. Roll dough out to fit pan and cover. Be sure to cut a few vent holes.
- bake until golden brown, 15-20 minutes.
- if you can stand it, let sit 10 minutes before eating.

- _note:_ 1 head small cabbage should yield about 8 cups of shredded cabbage
- _note:_ can substitute 9 slices of american cheese, torn into smaller pieces
