- _note_: can use a whole onion, minced, if preferred. chop and cook gently over medium heat in the bacon grease until softened before adding the potatoes. do not let onions brown.
- _note_: original recipe calls for 1 teaspoon parsley added before serving. we quite often forget this, so it's a to taste type of ingredient.
