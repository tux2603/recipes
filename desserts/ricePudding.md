| 6 cups       | whole milk            |            |
| 1/2 cup      | sugar                 |            |
| 1/2 teaspoon | salt                  |            |
| 1/2 cup      | long-grain white rice |            |

- combine 5 1/2 cups of milk, the sugar, and salt in a large saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat
- add the rice and reduce the heat to low. Cook, stirring occasionally and maintaining a gentle simmer, until the rice is soft and pudding has thickened to the consistency of yogurt, 50-60 minutes
- stir in vanilla, then transfer the pudding to a bowl and refrigerate until cold, about 2 hours
- stir in the remaining 1/2 cup of milk and serve
